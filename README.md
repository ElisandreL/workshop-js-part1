# Javascript - First workshop. 

Here are few notes taken during the workshop about basic js. 

## How to use it ? 

First of all, take care of the little sign saying you face a comment : `/*` ... `*/`

Each topic and its examples are between comments tag :

You see that there is an other kind of comment tag : //

**DON'T TOUCH THEM** 

they are here to go=ive instructions and comments, to help you to understand what's going on. If they are note `//`, your code will break and you don't want that. 

To make the script working, just remove the `/*` at the begining of the example and the `*/` at the end *or write your own lines of code between to examples*.

Last but not least, do you see this little arrow in the left column, just before the `/*` tag ? Click on it. They are pretty usefull to minimize the block wrapped between two comments tags, making the script more readable. And web developers likes readables scripts.
